I've been wanting to set up some sort of professional website for a while now, and have been unsure of the best way to do it. I have considered paying for a VPS and hosting Wordpress, but have had trouble bringing myself to do so because I figured there would be some better option.  Today I happened to stumble across [Github Pages][pages], which lets you host a website from your Github respository.  It also lets you set it up at your custom domain name, which was something I wanted.  As such, I decided to check it out.

That brought me to the question of how write the website. I'm pretty sure that it only accepts static files, so that rules out anything like Wordpress.  Instead, I went with the option that Github suggests--[Jekyll][jekyll].  Jekyll is a Ruby site generator that takes text marked down in a number of ways (their own syntax, text, HTML, etc) and spits out a static site.  I'm not sure if I'll stick with it or find some problem and switch to another option later, but I'd definitely like to give it a shot.

My goal for this site is to have a place to store information about my task of learning about IT.  I hope to write posts covering problems I have had (including some that I'll hopefully solve), and to have a place to host my résumé and generally create a centralized web presence for myself.
