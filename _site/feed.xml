        <title>New Website</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to set up some sort of professional website for a while now, and have been unsure of the best way to do it. I have considered paying for a VPS and hosting Wordpress, but have had trouble bringing myself to do so because I figured there would be some better option.  Today I happened to stumble across &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you host a website from your Github respository.  It also lets you set it up at your custom domain name, which was something I wanted.  As such, I decided to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brought me to the question of how write the website. I’m pretty sure that it only accepts static files, so that rules out anything like Wordpress.  Instead, I went with the option that Github suggests–&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.  Jekyll is a Ruby site generator that takes text marked down in a number of ways (their own syntax, text, HTML, etc) and spits out a static site.  I’m not sure if I’ll stick with it or find some problem and switch to another option later, but I’d definitely like to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this site is to have a place to store information about my task of learning about IT.  I hope to write posts covering problems I have had (including some that I’ll hopefully solve), and to have a place to host my résumé and generally create a centralized web presence for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
